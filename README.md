# ecommerce-website

The ecommerce website is an extension and improvement upon an application developed on a team of four during my summer semester of college. 

The original website is a barebones application that utilizeses front-end (HTML,CSS), backend (node.js, Javascript, Typescript), and data management (MongoDB). 

Planned implementations to simulate an agile work environment:

--Improve UI/UX 
--Improve user functionality
--Implement blockchain payment processing technologies
--More imrpovements TBD
